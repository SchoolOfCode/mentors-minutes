# Mentors Retrospective 18/11/20

## Mentor sharing

Especially when it came to tech help, it would be useful to have joint sessions with more than one bootcamper.

We could have once a week (or fortnight) drop in with a revolving roster of the more technical tutors who would be able to help people. Like an soc code bar?

## Meeting in person
It was raised that it would be really helpful for mentors and mentees to meet in person for the first time. 

Also the idea of social events with bootcampers and mentors was raised. This would also facilitate organic mentor sharing.

Some mentors were also very keen to come on the trip to facebook...

## Feedback

It would be useful to know what people are struggling with. We could have an anonymous google form that mentors or bootcampers could fill in to let us know what they are struggling with.

## What to talk about

Some mentioned not always knowing what to talk about and that the bootcampers were not sure what they wanted from the relationship. 

When we have retros at the end of the week, we could try and guide the bootcampers to have a clearer idea of what to chat to their mentors about at that time.

Could we also allocate time within the schedule to talk to mentors?

## Technical Help vs Personal Relationship

At present we have mentors who can give help on the subject of the course and those who have more of a career/long-term quality. Some fall into both camps but the experience was not consistent.

We could separate the mentorship and have two kinds of mentor - a technical helper and a career goal mentor. It could be that each person has two mentors or that you have one career mentor and then there are a pool of tech help mentors available on slack and in person.

## Expectations

A few mentors didnâ€™t know about the mentor packs. So we can make sure that they all receive them!

## Are we trying to produce developers?

Becoming a developer is not the only route available to people leaving the school of code. However, equipping people with the skills they need so that they could become a developer puts them in the best place to start their careers. Mentors are in a good place to help students find the right path after leaving the bootcamp.
